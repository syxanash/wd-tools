A little snapshot of life in West End after the flood peak feat. Jonathan Sri and Any McMahon.\n\nFrom the ABC: “Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the weather system had dumped the equivalent of 80 per cent of the region's total annual rainfall in two to three days. She said over 30 suburbs across the south-east had received over 1000mm of rainfall.”\n\nBy the time I got up the street was already completely cleared. You wouldn’t have known it had flooded if it wasn’t for the people cleaning out the businesses that were inundated.\n\nI was expecting to get out with my shovel picking up trash. But Peter told me the RCC Builders from the construction sites were all out cleaning up the streets in the early hours. I suppose it benefits them not tracking mud everywhere, but it’s such a nice thing to do. I’m very grateful.\n\nNow I have power back, the dishwasher and washing machine are humming away. I appreciate the breeze from the fan. It’s 31 and partly cloudy. Humidity is cloying. But we’ll work things out.",

And front row seats to the fireworks at Riverfire. We almost missed the C-17A Globemaster III until it flew riiiight over the top of us.\n\nThis was really my first big vlog with the Sony ZV-1 and you might be able to tell I got progressively better at using it over the course of the video (thankfully haha). Truly, plonking myself at one of the tables out at Hamilton and playing with ALL the settings was one of the best ways to learn that actually the program modes are more useful than the manual modes, especially for the night stuff.\n\n",

You may want to plan it around one of your interests, make it a Gaudí bike tour, a local markets bike tour, or a green bike tour, or even a tapas bike tour, though it might get a bit harder to pedal after the 4th restaurant.

          "title": "My Guide to Ogijima (Seto Inland Sea, Japan)",
          "description": "Hello and welcome to Ogijima. I was fortunate to call this tiny island home for a few months and I’d love to show you around.\nSo, where are we? Ogijima is in Japan’s Seto Inland Sea, about 40 minutes by ferry from Takamatsu. \nAnd what does Ogijima, locally known as Ogi, actually mean? Let’s look at the three characters that make up the name.\nIt’s literally Man Tree Island and interestingly enough it’s right next to Megijima, yep you guessed it — Woman Tree Island.\nOgi is tiny - you can walk around it in an hour or so, and it’s home to about 160 people. \nThe great thing about the island is that it’s relatively unknown — so don’t let this video go viral. The majority of tourists head to the bigger islands nearby like Naoshima and Shodoshima. \nIf you’re looking for big-ticket items, Ogi is probably not for you, but if want authentic Japanese island culture, then you’re in the right place. \nJi no ana, the cave, isn’t really well promoted but it’s definitely worth checking out. \nAnd if you’re looking for a good vantage point on the north, head up to Tank Rock. \nThe steps here at Toyotamahime Shrine are one of the most popular places on the island for instagrammers and there are extra points on offer if you manage to get one of the ferries in the background.\nOgi is one of the so-called “art islands” of the Seto Inland Sea so there are some pieces permanently on display and every three years there’s an art festival with installations set up in some of the old homes and buildings.\nSo this is the soul of Ogijima and while it’s incredibly beautiful it can also be incredibly dangerous.\nProbably stating the obvious, but this is the lighthouse. And although the water here may look very inviting, it’s probably best not to swim here - the current is extremely strong.\nThis beach has the best range of skimming rocks that I’ve ever seen.\nSo the water all around the island is completely beautiful and sometimes you just want to go and jump into the water.\nMy favourite beach is actually right near the main port.\nYou can’t get to that beach from above. You have to swim there. It’s a beautiful private beach.\nThe beaches near the fishing port are much more accessible.\nLong-term resident Yamato Fukui says: \"Where the fishing port is now, 35 years ago there used to be one long beautiful beach where us kids would swim — there wasn’t a (school) pool back then.\"\nThere are lots of swimming options, but you have to get the times right so the tide isn’t too low. \nThe passage on the north of Ogi is known as the Ginza of the Sea and it’s said to be busier than Tokyo Port. \nAnd sailors aren’t the only ones passing through the waters. Wild boar actually swim to Ogi and once they arrive they’re not welcomed by people with gardens and they face the danger of being trapped and killed.\nThere were some locals who wanted to promote Ogi as “cat island” but others are fiercely opposed. \nSome tourists come specifically to see and feed the cats, but the feline population is now on the decline after a successful sterilisation program. \nThe library functions as the island’s cultural hub where new residents are welcomed and events take place. \nOne of the books on the shelves at the library is the bestselling novel Battle Royale.\nOn the inside cover is a map of the “fictitious” island named Okishima. \nBlogger David Billa says: “But when you read the book it’s actually very clear, the author came here and inspired himself from here to write and describe his island.”\nMy favourite part of Ogi is the stone wall settlement. Narrow streets cling to sides of the steep hills and you can walk between the old houses and imagine you’ve been transported back to simpler times.\nUnfortunately some overly enthusiastic visitors wander into people’s homes to take a closer look. Don’t be one of those people.\nThere are a lot of wells and although there is now town water, many homes still rely on well water.\nYou won’t see many cars on Ogijima, you’re more likely to see Onba.\nOnba? \nTraditionally used to cart babies around, onba are now a symbol of the island and locals use them to cart goods up and down the steep streets.\nThe last boat back to Takamatsu leaves at 5pm but who am I to stop you pitching a tent on the flat ground near the harbour if you want to stay for the night?\n\nCHAPTERS:\n00:00-00:16 David Douglas Stuart introduces Ogijima\n00:17-01:04  Ogijima: location, meaning and the basics\n01:05- 01:33 Things to see on Ogijima: Ji no ana, Tank Rock and the very instagramable Toyotamahime Shrine steps\n01:34-02:00 Ogijima's art (be careful)\n02:01-03:08 Beaches and swimming on Ogijima\n03:09-03:49 A busy shipping route, wild boars and Ogijima's cats\n03:50-04:17 The books of Ogijima\n04:18- 04:39 Ogijima's stone wall settlement\n04:40-05:02 The wells and 'onba' of Ogijima\n05:03-05:12 Ogijima's last Meon ferry back to Takamatsu \n05:13-05:39 David Douglas Stuart thanks his supporters\n\n\nThank you to Captain Inoue: https://www.youtube.com/user/gappegou",
