WebGL or Web Graphics Library is basically a clone of something called OpenGL. Most triple AAA game developers use OpenGL or DirectX or both. So having this hardware accelerated ability within the web browsers is pretty cool in my books. But as awesome as it is, there are some stumbling blocks. According to Google's webmasters guideline, Google does not index WebGL web pages, which will enviably put all those awesome projects in a disadvantage compared to the older html style grandpa pages. There is also an issue of WebGL textures being extra cautious with their origins, preventing any linking in of external photos or videos; Which is a bummer and kind of weird since the older 2D canvas allows it. I have been working on a hybrid (HTML + WebGL) web page engine as of late.

Kenxsys 3D is the name I gave for a subset of features of my Internet One Operating system that deals with the Kenx web server and hardware accelerated engine on the browser side of things. 

The browser environment is a great open and safe place to root a new user based system that utilizes the GPU along side the CPU for its everyday tasks that are most often limited to the CPU only. I had to reinvent the wheel in some regards, but things are all the better for it. When a platform uses less CPU power to do standard things like moving and resizing graphical interfaces, it naturally reduces wear and tear on the machines and also extends batteries and cuts the electricity bill in the process.
