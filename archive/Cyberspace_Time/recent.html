Kenxsys 3D is the name I gave for a subset of features of my Internet One Operating system that deals with the Kenx web server and hardware accelerated engine on the browser side of things. 

The browser environment is a great open and safe place to root a new user based system that utilizes the GPU along side the CPU for its everyday tasks that are most often limited to the CPU only. I had to reinvent the wheel in some regards, but things are all the better for it. When a platform uses less CPU power to do standard things like moving and resizing graphical interfaces, it naturally reduces wear and tear on the machines and also extends batteries and cuts the electricity bill in the process.
