<p>My first real job was working in the pre-production department of my local newspaper. During the afternoons, I would typeset press releases and public notices. In the evenings, up until the legally-allowed time for a 15-year-old to remain on the clock, I would transform the PDF pages of some 15+ publications to aluminum plates for the humungous web-fed presses in the back.</p>

<p>It still seems crazy that anyone would allow a teenager to handle dangerous chemicals, stick their hands in giant metal stamping presses, and once I turned 16, drive across seven counties, unsupervised, in a gigantic panel van. I hardly ever betrayed that trust; in fact, I tried to treat my job like it was a privilege. Except for the one time I slipped in a fake obituary so I could show my professor and get out of an 8 am exam the next day, I was an exemplary employee.</p>

<p>I loved it all: the photography labs, the huge presses 20 feet tall, the massive ImageSetter that printed, not onto paper, but onto photographic film. Still, my favorite part of that job were the Macs. My school had once been loaned a few Macintosh Classic IIs for a month, and I had found myself sneaking into the classroom and spending as much time as possible in front of. When the loan was revoked, I turned to solace in the remaining Apple II in the corner that nobody else cared to use.</p>

<p>I had desperately wanted a Mac, but the reasoning of the time was against me: Apple was not doing well, and software in retail stores was difficult to come by; Windows 3.1 was the dominant force, and Windows 95 promised to revolutionize the PC experience by making it equivalent with MacOS.</p>

<p>So, when I got my job at the newspaper, I relished every second with my Macs. I would spend late nights there, sometimes attempting to learn Pascal, but mostly poking and prodding at every button, setting and Preferences file I could find. Sometimes, on Saturdays, with little to do between deadlines, my supervisor would let me invite my friends over. The four of us, spread between the four blazing-fast PowerMac G3s in the office, would play Doom or Quake until the final newspaper of the day would submit its morning edition at 2 am.</p>

<p>I grew to love my MacOS machines, and as I transitioned my love of newspapers from high school job to early career, I was delighted to find I got to use my Mac every single day. I even drug an iMac from work to home every evening, presuambly so that I could “do work,” but really because I just loved the MacOS experience. My aged PC monstrosity in the corner was largely ignored; I certainly did not have the money to buy a new Mac, but carting one with a handle back-and-forth from work would do just fione.</p>

<p>That’s not to say it was all sunshine and rainbows; in fact, MacOS Classic was awful. It wasn’t truly a multitasking operating system, it had terrible memory management, and to support the 6800 CPU, could in fact force the operating system to run in 24-bit mode. The whole thing was insanity, and you simultaneously ran more than one application at your own peril.</p>

<p>The problems of MacOS were not new; in fact, DOS and Windows (up until Windows XP) had largely similar problems. It was Apple’s lack of real, usable solutions, however, that caused MacOS to linger while Windows thrived. Apple abandoned its own development platform, MacApp, with MacOS 7, and instead third-party tools were really the only available development platforms on the Mac. Apple tried to make parternships with other companies, like Symantec, but ultimately mis-management and corporate animosity ended these arrangements quickly.</p>

<p>I’ve used versions of Windows from 2 to 2022, OS/2 from 2 to Warp, BeOS, Netware, Irix and every flavor of Linux I can find. And, of course I stare every day at the latest incarnation of macOS. But, still, I love the visual feel of Platinum, the name Apple gave to the UI in MacOS 8 and 9.</p>

<p>It’s easy to get confused, as Apple has changed the name they use to refer to the Macintosh’s operating system. Here’s a quick table of the name’s evolution:</p>

<p>After MacOS X gained traction, and eventually developers ported their ‘Classic Compatibility Layer’ or ‘Carbonized’ applications to the more modern and NeXT-based ‘Cocoa’ framework, Apple renamed all versions of MacOS before OS X 10 as “Classic” MacOS. Sometime in the late 2010s, apple began lowercasing the Mac when referring to its modern OS, stylizing it <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">macOS</code>.</p>

<p>It had been some time since I used a MacOS Classic computer regularly. These days, I may occassioanlly need to open a file in QuarkXPress 3 or NewsEditPro from my days as a newspaper reporter; I even still remember all the keyboard shortcuts, it turns out. But, largely, I have forgotten this old and trusted friend.</p>

<p>MacOS 8 was released in July of 1997, nearly four years after it was first announced as “Copland” in 1994. In reality, Copland had been in the works since 1988 as Project Pink, and involved a drama of epic proportions with all the major computing titans of the time. System 7, the predecessor to MacOS 8, was aged–like, horribly aged. Apple, in financial trouble, was concerned that the rise of Windows could spell the end of the Macintosh. It tried selling System 7 as a replacment operating system OS/2 to IBM, but the project named Taligent fizzled within 2 years. Internal development was almost at a standstill, and the <strong>company</strong> eventually looked outward.</p>

<p>BeOS, an alternative operating system for Apple and clone PowerPC computers, looked promising, but eventually Apple turned to Steve Jobs and his company NeXT. The NeXT OPENStep framework was already cross-compatible and mature, while BeOS, while impressive, was new and had large gaps in functionality.</p>

<p>Steve Jobs, returned to his throne at Apple, decried that the remnants of Pink and Taligent would become MacOS 8 (and eventually MacOS 9), while the NeXT’s UNIX-based operating system would become MacOS X (or 10). MacOS 8-9 were a bridge to the future; while most of the litany of changes were foundational adds and performance tweaks, the new Platinum user interface from Copland was introduced, which remained through the life of MacOS Classic (and, in fact, was the UI for the first release of MacOS Rhapsody, the forefather of the modern macOS).</p>

<p>Since the release of the Hierarchical File System (or HFS) with the Macintosh Hard Disk 20 in 1985, files included multiple forks. All files contained a “data” fork, or the actual contents of the file; however every file could also contain a Resource Fork, or additional data store within the same file. A word processing document could, for instance, store the text contents within the data fork, and store any embedded images within the Resource fork of the file. Applications often used these Resource forks as well to store things like icons, images, patterns, sounds, color pallettes, and tons of other metadata. It’s sometimes quite amazing the raw resources available in these Resource forks.</p>

<p>I went about extracting these Resource forks to see what I could find.</p>

<p>Booting it up</p>

<p>First, I downloaded the MacOS 8.6 install cd from the Internet Archive. I was sure I had done something wrong, though, when I double-clicked on the ISO file I downloaded: nothing happened. In fact, you have to use a <a href="https://www.matthewhughes.co.uk/how-to-mount-hfs-classic-drives-on-macos-catalina-and-later/">third-party tool to mount HFS disks in modern macOS</a>. Even then, I had trouble extracting the Resource Forks. So I decided it was time to return to my old friend.</p>

<p>I decided what I needed was an actual running version of MacOS 8. I first thing I tried was the very awesome <a href="https://github.com/felixrieseberg/macintosh.js">Macintosh.js</a> app from <a href="https://github.com/felixrieseberg/macintosh.js">felixrieseberg</a>, but ran into a few setbacks. First, the emulated system is running a 68K processor, and therefore the maximum verison of MacOS those processors can run is 8.1. MacOS Platinum hadn’t quite been fleshed out until MacOS 8.5. Also, I had trouble extracting files with their Resource Forks intact (more on that later).</p>

<p>It then became necessary to take the more complex route and download MacOS 8 and install <a href="https://www.emaculation.com/doku.php/sheepshaver">SheepShaver</a>, which emulates a full PowerPC Mac. SheepShaver allows us to run all the way up to MacOS 9.0.4. I could have installed MacOS 9; however, very few UI changes took place between MacOS 8.6 and MacOS 9, and because the MacOS 8 interface guidelines are publicly documented, I’ve decided to focus on 8.6.</p>

<p>Installing SheepShaver is easy, but getting it setup is a little more complicated. First, you need a MacOS ROM file. I tried an <a href="https://archive.org/details/mac_rom_archive_-_as_of_8-19-2011">older ROM file</a> that contained the Macintosh Toolbox, the part of the ROM that contained some UI specifics. But try as I might I could not extract any resources from the ROM file. I decided instead to use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_ROM">New World ROM</a>, even though I was pretty sure the Macintosh Toolbox assets would not be included; I’d have to look inside the OS itself.</p>

<p>I placed the SheepShaver app, the MacOS ROM file in my Applications folder. I opened SheepShaver and went straight into the settings, ignoring the failing boot. First I created a new Hard Drive disk, and added my Mac OS 8.6 Install CD ISO into the window. Next, I made sure my ROM file was correct in the settings, and set my “Unix Root” to my home folder. I changed the RAM to 64 MB, and then switched to the Audio/Video tab to adjust my resolution and enable QuickDraw acceleration.</p>

<p>Then, in a strange example of a bad UI, I force-quit SheepShaver and re-opened, and then magically my new Mac began to boot.</p>

<p><img src="https://res.craft.do/user/full/f6bf69d9-c199-b5e2-2561-223aac7866f6/doc/21B84071-5847-4B88-BE10-7257963581FF/26325A87-8FA6-4302-9DB6-AF51589B6471_2/nbcqegm8wOnDKXtaBa5ckzqxabcNxZqgIrLtem2C1ewz/Screen%20Shot%202024-02-08%20at%2012.49.10PM%201.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>I downloaded <a href="https://github.com/andrews05/ResForge">ResForge</a>, a Resource Fork editor, onto my Host Mac to get at the meat of the files. Resource forks contain a list of Resources, grouped by type. I started looking through the common Resource fork types I knew of.</p>

<h3 id="table-1">Table<a class="anchorjs-link " href="#table-1" aria-label="Anchor" data-anchorjs-icon="" style="font: 1em / 1 anchorjs-icons; padding-left: 0.375em;"></a></h3>

<p>With MacOS 8 and the Platinum interface, also came the Appearance Manager, a sytem utility that allows you to tweak the interface. While not fully documented and released until MacOS 8.5, the Appearance Manager could use theme files to change the appearance of the system. And by change, I mean dramatically. Before Apple fully embraced the idea, I spent hours and hours using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaleidoscope_(software)">Kaleidoscope</a> to craft the perfect desktop UI. Luckily, Apple created a theme file for it’s default Platinum UI, allowing us to peruse the Resource fork for some juicy UI morsels.</p>

<p>In the <strong>Macintosh HD: System Folder:Appearance:Theme Files</strong> is a filed named Apple platinum. I copied this folder from my SheepShaver instance to my local machine and opened up Resforge to dive in. I also copied and opened up the Appearance Control Panel, found in the <strong>Macintosh HD:System Folder:Control Panels</strong> folder.</p>

<p>Also, found within those files, are these very nice and fun credits:</p>

I also copied over the **Macintosh HD: System Folder:Appearance:Sound Sets:Platinum Sounds** file and extracted all the awesome interface sounds from that file. MacOS 8 was awesome in that, not only could you provide a theme file for the visual part of your experience, you could also load in a sound theme. This was definitely a devisive feature; as a youth, all the clicks and clacks delighted me, but my older co-workers were adamantly against.

Other files with gold are the Macintosh HD:System Folder:System, Macintosh HD:System Folder:System Resources and Macintosh HD:System Folder:Finder have several resources we will need, such as cursors, icons and images. 

I used [Permute from Setapp](https://setapp.com/apps/permute) to do image and sound conversions; most of the images, patterns and icons will be exported as ICNS or TIFF, and the sound resources will be exported as AIFF. I chose MP3 as the final audio format, though I may add support for multiple formats (such as OGG and M4A) at a later time. 

I specifically chose PNG for icons because I needed support of the Alpha channel. MacOS icons on the desktop are overlaid with a halftone pattern when opened; we needed the alpha channel so we could keep the shape of the icon while also overlaying the pattern.

<p>While it was time consuming, it was still relatively simple to find the raw image and audio resources I needed to replicate the interaface. What I didn’t have were the “geometry” and “composition” of the windows: what color are the bordes? How are the window borders drawn?</p>

<p>While the Resource forks do contain some information on the geometry of UI elements, they are not exactly human readable—at least not using ResForge. I could have used a more specialized Resource fork editor, such as <a href="https://www.mathemaesthetics.com/EdInfo.html">Resourcerer</a>, which might have given me more options to extra UI data from system files. However, I wasn’t counting on this being the case.</p>

<p>I also attempted to decode <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacApp">MacApp</a>, the original Apple-supported development framework for MacOS Classic apps, in both its Pascal and C++ variants. However, I found the project had been abandoned far before the Platinum user interface was introduced, so the results were not what I had hoped: I saw a lot of System 7 interface components, but nothing specifically Platinum.</p>

<p>To my surprise, though, the Platinum interface that I had fallen in love with hadn’t been entirely introduced in MacOS 8: in fact, small bread crumbs had been left in later versions of System 7.</p>

<p>A System 7 vs MacOS 8 Window. While different, there are visual similarities between the two.</p>

<p>I had little luck in finding any geometry information about the windows, so I decided to study the <a href="http://interface.free.fr/Archives/Apple_HIGOS8_Guidelines.pdf">Apple Human Interface Guidelines</a> for MacOS 8. There is a treasure trove of detailed UI schematics available, but the manual doesn’t specify any colors or measurements for the UI elements.</p>

<p><img src="https://res.craft.do/user/full/f6bf69d9-c199-b5e2-2561-223aac7866f6/doc/21B84071-5847-4B88-BE10-7257963581FF/950BC5FF-2FD8-4D1E-A41D-F70868B54027_2/oMJwx7qKxkTnKA3GtxnjueyxsgNc6YEeiouDivsbItEz/PICT%20128.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>The Apple Platinum theme logo, hidden inside the Apple platinum theme file’s Resource fork.</p>

<p>Nearly all of the standard HTML elements are represented in the HIG: everything from buttons to fieldsets are presented. I started to jot down, in my notebook, all the different components and how they were related to one another: a Button would contain text and, possibly, an image, while a Window would contain any number of other UI components. Before long, I had a pretty strong hiearchary of all the components and how they interacted.</p>

<p>There are a lot of very specific advisements in the HIG around proper element spacing and alignment; I made it a goal to bake these in where possible, but I also remembered that the goal of this project was to be a wrapper for another application. I can provide guides, but ultimately the developer will own the finished result.</p>

<p>There were also a few components I decided against making. The Control Strip, ubiquitius in MacOS as an easy way to change system settings without switching to a Control Panel application, is not really suited for a web app. As well, I decided against the Utility and Palette window styles, as I didn’t see myself using them at the moment. I’ve tagged them as efforts for another day; we still have plenty left to do.</p>

<p>If I was going to rebuild the UI from scratch, I was definitely going to need some colors. I was pretty sure that screenshots of a running MacOS 8 system inside an emulator would not represent the color of Platinum accurately. My initial tests showed this to be true; I could get different values based on the ROM I used or the Video adapter tweaks I made. The HIG didn’t specify colors by value, but I hoped I could find them in a Resource fork somewhere.</p>

<p>Luckily, I was, along with the colors of all the default color theme variants that came with MacOS 8. There were 7 distinct shades of gray for the system interface, not including black and white. Things like window backgrounds, border colors and other common interface elements use these 7 shades of gray to draw the bulk of the interface.</p>

<p>In MacOS 8, elements like scroll bars, menu selections and text highlighting are given an additional “color” variation theme. This gives the interface an additional layer of customization, without radically changing the entire UI. 20 color variations were included with MacOS 8.6; by default, the system used the “Lavender” color scheme.</p>

<p>Default themes shipped with MacOS 8.6: Default, Sunny, Bubbles and Golden Poppy.</p>

<p>And, to top it all off, you could combine a color variation, background image, system font and sound theme together to create your own custom Platinum theme. You could then save these themes and then switch between them. I often took advantage of this, creating a “Dark Mode” theme which helped a dark-room-adjacent server stop bleeding light onto my negatives.</p>

<p>Each color variation is made up of 7 shades of color, ordered from darkest to brightest.</p>

<p>Apple Platinum theme file, and the colors for the Bondi theme, opened in ResForge</p>

<p>I extracted these colors, as well as a few background images I found in the theme file.</p>

<p>Then, I took a ton of screenshots. I installed as many late-model apps as I could find: I scoured the Macintosh Repository and the Internet Archive for Shareware CDs. I looked for a Hotline server archive, but alas I could not find one.</p>

<p>I focused a lot of my research on AppleWorks 6; while it seemed like an outlier in terms of design and didn’t always follow Apple’s own HIG, most of the system components were left unmodified. I used this app as a reference sketch for plotting out how I would componentize this entire UI later on.</p>

<p>It had all the components that I thought I would need. I made a list, checked against the HIG to see if I’d missed anything, and came up with the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Desktop
    <ul>
      <li>Desktop Menu Bar
        <ul>
          <li>Images</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Context/Dropdown Menu</li>
      <li>Window
        <ul>
          <li>Regular Window</li>
          <li>Modal Window</li>
          <li>Title Bar</li>
          <li>
            <p>Control Boxes</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Close</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Zoom</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Collapse</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Resize</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Scoll Bars</li>
          <li>
            <p>UI Components</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Button</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Dropdown Menu</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>Long variant, with values</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Short variant, with no values</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Checkbox</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Radio button</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Fieldset (control group)</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Progress</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Text Input</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I’m sure there will be other components I want to add over time, but I felt like this was a good starting place.</p>

<p>I was pretty confident about my choices here, and I must admit it is only because I’ve been keeping a secret. This isn’t the first time this has been done, and in fact, this isn’t the first time that I’ve done this. My project <a href="https://github.com/robbiebyrd/platinum">https://github.com/robbiebyrd/platinum</a> was already in existence well before I decided to revisit this topic again after 4 years.</p>

<p>I first created my version of <a href="https://github.com/robbiebyrd/platinum">Platinum</a> in 2019 by forking the amazing work of <a href="https://github.com/npjg">npjg</a> and his <a href="https://github.com/npjg/classic.css">https://github.com/npjg/classic.css</a> project. I extended it as part of <a href="https://github.com/Keeping-History/rt911/">my project 9/11 Realtime</a> and used it as a time-representative user interface.</p>

<p>The Platinum project was created using a mish-mash of CSS from several projects and a spaghetti-code mess of event handlers for controlling things like window resizes and closes. It has so far been starred 44 times and used in a handful of post-grad student projects. It has been embarressing for me to connect with up-and-coming developers around the world, trying to debug code I’m sure would deny them their well-earned degree.</p>

<p>Ever since, I’ve wished I could go back and start over with a modern framework. I had transitioned into backend development a few years before, so I had missed a lot of the fun involved with component-based design and, especially, the React framework. I decided it was time to re-teach myself how to front-end dev again, and this was the perfect project to work on.</p>

<p>I spent a little time refreshing my consulting site, <a href="https://www.gospacehippo.com">Space Hippo</a>, and learning about React’s effect hook to make fun animations. Then I dove into state management and event reducers, and found soon React was the perfect tool for a Platinum project revamp.</p>

<p>I sketched out the component structure as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <platinumdesktop>
</platinumdesktop>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <platinumdesktopcontext>
</platinumdesktopcontext>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <aplatinumapp> - A Custom app

  - <appcontextprovider>

      - <platinumdesktopicon>

      - <platinumwindow>

          - &lt;PlatinumUIComponents?&gt;

          - <anyotherreactcomponent>

</anyotherreactcomponent></platinumwindow></platinumdesktopicon></appcontextprovider></aplatinumapp>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>I deliberated a lot over the nesting of components, and in the end hoped that this order would allow PlatinumApps to be more easily packaged. I also hoped that putting a Window in charge of its own contents would not turn out to be a mistake.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A React Context is a data structure that allows sharing state between components.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I also decided ultimately to wire up any PlatinumUIComponent that accepted some kind of input directly to the AppContext. This way, the app itself could keep an eye on the values of each component within each window, allowing one window to change the contents of another.</p>

<p>Finally, I decided to insert a PlatinumDesktopContext to hold all  of the system settings; specifically, I needed a place to store the theme settings. While I eventually decided to use CSS variables to set theme colors throughout the entire app, I still needed a place to stash Sound file resources, desktop background settings and font selections for the theme. This allows me to change the theme from inside an App, and have that change copied over to all over Platinum Apps, Windows and UI Components. In fact, the app Appearance Manager that is included in the Platinum React project is simply a regular app that reports an Event when the theme is selected from a dropdown. I’ll talk more about events later.</p>

<p>Now that I had my components defined, I sketched them out quickly, just for structure. There really wasn’t much to them, but I needed a canvas to start working. I created a blank PlatinumDesktop, PlatinumDesktopIcon, PlatinumWindow and PlatinumButton as a starting point, with no CSS. Then, I got to the hard, hard work.</p>

<p>As I started zooming into the PDF version of the Apple HIG, I noticed patterns start to emerge: all the window borders, both out and inset, were consistent throughout. It was also easy to see that, where there were variations, they were slight–and they were also repeated. I was able to make a hierarchy of element boders using the CSS properties <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">border</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">box-shadow</code>.</p>
