			"webXP sports the same visual design you're used to, with slight blue gradients throughout, and robust functionality. All the themes you're used to have been adapted to work on high resolution screens, so you'll see XP in a quality like never before. <br><br>The Start menu is included in full, and highlights all the apps you can check out to play with.<br><br>If you're a fan of the classic theme, don't worry! That's an option too.",
			"webXP is built without the use of modern libraries like React or Angular. This means it'll feel lightweight and snappy, regardless of your system's performance!<br><br>We don't recommend using webXP on older machines, as web standards have moved on a lot from old browsers, plus, you've got the real thing you could run there :P",
			"webXP is built to be expandable with a ton of applications down the line, and there's already lots to check out. <br><br> webXP has integrated support for indexed databases, which means your copy of webXP will stay personalized with your files, folders, and preferences.",
			"We've made sure to keep everything in webXP as accurate to the native XP experience as possible. You'll feel right at home, and have fun finding some easter eggs along the way.",
			"webXP still has a long way to go! We'll be regularly updating it with new additions and features, plus tools to help you play with its innards more and make your own applications. Stay tuned!",
			"Something's gone amiss? An application ran offscreen? Not to worry. webXP comes with a variety of tools to help you squish any problems that pop up. If you ever need them, the Task Manager and JS Console are right there at your disposal.",
			"webXP is built by a small team of a few people, putting their free time into giving you something fun. You can stay confident this project's lighthearted nature will stick around."
